     The Surrey biodiversity Information Centre performs 3 core functions, data collection, collation and dissemination. Recording has a long history and people have been keeping records both as amateurs and professionals for many years. Local societies and groups have formed who have particular interests, e.g. mammals or birds. The SBIC offers a wide range of support and assistance to Surrey's local groups as well as to individuals.

We collect biological data from many different sources, but one of our remits is to encourage recording within the community. Biological Recording is an enjoyable, flexible and educational pastime which can also produce really high quality data.<br />

This information can potentially be used to inform decision-making county-wide and therefore play a vital role in Kent's development for people and wildlife. Consequently we offer support and advice to anyone who is interested in recording and developing their identification skills in many or just one species group.
